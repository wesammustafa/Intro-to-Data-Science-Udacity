# Intro to Data Science (Udacity)

This repo contains my solution to the Udacity course "Intro to Data Science" which can be found [here](https://eg.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359). This course is about 2 months long.



The Introduction to Data Science class will survey the foundational topics in data science, namely:

- Data Manipulation
- Data Analysis with Statistics and Machine Learning
- Data Communication with Information Visualization
- Data at Scale -- Working with Big Data

The class will focus on breadth and present the topics briefly instead of focusing on a single topic in depth. This will give you the opportunity to sample and apply the basic techniques of data science.
